      title={The Complexity of Homomorphism Reconstructibility}, 
      author={Jan Boeker and Louis Haertel and Nina Runde and Tim Seppelt and Christoph Standke},
      abstract={Representing graphs by their homomorphism counts has led to the beautiful theory of homomorphism indistinguishability in recent years. Moreover, homomorphism counts have promising applications in database theory and machine learning, where one would like to answer queries or classify graphs solely based on the representation of a graph G as a finite vector of homomorphism counts from some fixed finite set of graphs to G. We study the computational complexity of the arguably most fundamental computational problem associated to these representations, the homomorphism reconstructability problem: given a finite sequence of graphs and a corresponding vector of natural numbers, decide whether there exists a graph G that realises the given vector as the homomorphism counts from the given graphs.
We show that this problem yields a natural example of an $\mathsf{NP}^{#\mathsf{P}}$-hard problem, which still can be ùñ≠ùñØ-hard when restricted to a fixed number of input graphs of bounded treewidth and a fixed input vector of natural numbers, or alternatively, when restricted to a finite input set of graphs. We further show that, when restricted to a finite input set of graphs and given an upper bound on the order of the graph G as additional input, the problem cannot be ùñ≠ùñØ-hard unless ùñØ=ùñ≠ùñØ. For this regime, we obtain partial positive results. We also investigate the problem's parameterised complexity and provide fpt-algorithms for the case that a single graph is given and that multiple graphs of the same order with subgraph instead of homomorphism counts are given.},

      title={On the Parameterized Complexity of Learning Monadic Second-Order Formulas}, 
      author={Steffen van Bergerem and Martin Grohe and Nina Runde},
      abstract={Within the model-theoretic framework for supervised learning introduced by Grohe and Tur√°n (TOCS 2004), we study the parameterized complexity of learning concepts definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO). We show that the problem of learning a consistent MSO-formula is fixed-parameter tractable on structures of bounded tree-width and on graphs of bounded clique-width in the 1-dimensional case, that is, if the instances are single vertices (and not tuples of vertices). This generalizes previous results on strings and on trees. Moreover, in the agnostic PAC-learning setting, we show that the result also holds in higher dimensions. Finally, via a reduction to the MSO-model-checking problem, we show that learning a consistent MSO-formula is para-NP-hard on general structures.},
