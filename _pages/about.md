Hello! I am a first year PhD student supervised by [Prof Martin Grohe](https://www.lics.rwth-aachen.de/cms/LICS/Der-Lehrstuhl/Team/Dozierende/~ocwf/Martin-Grohe) at the [Chair for Logic and Theory of Discrete Systems](https://www.lics.rwth-aachen.de) at RWTH Aachen University.

I am currently working on evaluating dynamic node embedding algorithms for [this DFG project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/453349072). I also teach a practical course on Machine Learning on Graphs this winter term 2023/2024.
My Master Thesis was on the parameterized complexity of a learning problem where we aim to learn monadic second order formulas based on positive and negative examples from a relational structure.
